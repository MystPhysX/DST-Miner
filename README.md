# DST-Miner
Collab mod with ZupaleX

This will be an implementation of a miner for Do Not Starve Together.


To-Do:
- Come up with mod outline.


Ideas:
- Mines stone randomly at a random interval? E.g every segment (8 segments per day) a function runs with a chance of success (60-75%?). If the function suceeds then it has a chance of "digging up" any item from the list below.
- The chance of an item getting "dug up" depends on the biome in which the miner is placed.
- Miner has internal inventory of a chest/spits items on the ground/spits item into chest.
- Option to disable Archery integration so you don't have to have Archery installed.


List of Diggable items (configurable):
- Stone (common)
- Flint (common)
- Gold (uncommon)
- Nitre (uncommon)
- Gems (rare) (depends on biome)
- Anything else?
