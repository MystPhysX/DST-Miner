# DST-Miner
Collab mod with ZupaleX

This will be an implementation of a miner for Do Not Starve Together.


To-Do:
- Come up with mod outline.


Ideas:
- Mines stone randomly at a random interval? E.g every segment (8 segments per day) a function runs with a chance of success (60-75%?). If the function suceeds then it has a chance of "digging up" any item from the list below.
    - ZupaleX: Yeah that's what I was also thinking

- The chance of an item getting "dug up" depends on the biome in which the miner is placed.
    - ZupaleX: I really love this idea. At first I was thinking maybe to limit it to quarry biomes but he!

- Miner has internal inventory of a chest/spits items on the ground/spits item into chest.
    - ZupaleX: I was thinking to store in in a "chest" (what you can see on the left of my sketch). This way it is also            limited and players have to come to empty the chest otherwise the digging process stops. You cannot have stuffs a bit         everywhere and come once per year to recolt a shitload of stuffs.

- Option to disable Archery integration so you don't have to have Archery installed.
    - ZupaleX: That was not even planned to be a dependency. I was just planning to use new stuffs that it could dig in my         other mods :-)


List of Diggable items (configurable):
- Stone (common) -> ZupaleX : yes
- Flint (common) -> ZupaleX : yes
- Gold (uncommon) -> ZupaleX : yes
- Nitre (uncommon) -> ZupaleX : yes but in the end common since it is as common as stone and flint when mining?
- Gems (rare) (depends on biome) - > ZupaleX : yes
- Anything else?
    - Moon Rocks (very rare)
    - New Material : Iron Ore (uncommon)
    - Bone Shards (uncommon)
    - Trinkets (rare) ?
