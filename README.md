# DST-Miner
Collab mod with ZupaleX

This will be an implementation of a miner for Do Not Starve Together.


To-Do:
- Come up with mod outline.


Ideas:
- Uses moles as fuel. (lol)
    - That is a funny idea but also an interesting one! What if it is fueled with regular burnable but a mole would immediatly fill it at max (or a much higher value than regular burnables)?
      - Mole lasts 2 days then (32 segments).
          - OK. What would be the total amount of time it can work when fully loaded?

Approved Ideas:
- Mines stone randomly at a random interval? E.g every segment (16 segments per day) a function runs with a chance of success (60-75%?). If the function suceeds then it has a chance of "digging up" any item from the list below.
- Above function has a chance to "jam" the miner if successful. Uses a wrench (new item) to unjam.
- The chance of an item getting "dug up" depends on the biome in which the miner is placed.
- Miner spits item into chest.
- 2 wrenches. 1st is a basic wrench requiring vanilla items to craft. Unjams the machine once. Advanced wrench requires iron ore and unjams the machine 5(?) times.

List of Diggable items (configurable):
- Stone (common)
- Flint (common)
- Nitre (common)
- Gold (uncommon)
- New Material : Iron Ore (uncommon) (depends on biome)
- Bone Shards (uncommon)
- Gems (rare) (depends on biome)
- Trinkets (rare)
- Moon Rocks (very rare) (depends on biome)
