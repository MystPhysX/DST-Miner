# DST-Miner
Collab mod with ZupaleX

This will be an implementation of a miner for Do Not Starve Together.


To-Do:
- Come up with mod outline.


Ideas:
- Uses moles as fuel. (lol)


Approved Ideas:
- Mines stone randomly at a random interval? E.g every segment (8 segments per day) a function runs with a chance of success (60-75%?). If the function suceeds then it has a chance of "digging up" any item from the list below.
- The chance of an item getting "dug up" depends on the biome in which the miner is placed.
- Miner spits item into chest.

List of Diggable items (configurable):
- Stone (common)
- Flint (common)
- Nitre (common)
- Gold (uncommon)
- New Material : Iron Ore (uncommon) (depends on biome)
- Bone Shards (uncommon)
- Gems (rare) (depends on biome)
- Trinkets (rare)
- Moon Rocks (very rare) (depends on biome)
